HALFWAY:
- calculate the number IDT has selected and use OMP to select the same amount of basis
- calculate the l2 error rate between the represented signal and orignal signal
- try to use OMP to follow the IDT and calculate the l2 error
- decide the stopping criteria for comparison, do we use k as k-sparse, or do we use a threshold. If using
  threshold, how do we set the threshold
FIRST PRIORITY:
-Get the result of using the same number of OMP and IDT. Use IDT until it stops and then use OMP for the same 
number of basis.

SECOND PRIORITY:
-check the stopping criteria for OMP
-implement the averaging part of doing the screening
-check the measure for performance, l2 error? sparsity? classificaion accuracy?
-implement OMP based screening
