-check the stopping criteria for OMP
-implement iterative DT
-implement the averaging part of doing the screening
-check the measure for performance, l2 error? sparsity? classificaion accuracy?


HALFWAY:
- calculate the number IDT has selected and use OMP to select the same amount of basis
- calculate the l2 error rate between the represented signal and orignal signal
- try to use OMP to follow the IDT and calculate the l2 error
